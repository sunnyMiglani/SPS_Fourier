Information about S
--------------------
The most unique of the three, makes a "star" shape.
Relying on high frequencies in S is probably our best bet, since S is
alot curvier than the other letters we need to classify.

Information about V
--------------------
much like "T" but rotated ~45'. the X made by V fans out more on the V's
that have curves in them, for example V1 compared to V2.
Kind of symmetric each side
Most have a vertical "blank" region cutting through the middle (cause?)

Information about T
--------------------
T's are very consistent
The typical "X" made in the fourier space is rotated slightly for T's
that have a sloping top, or a stem that slopes to the left.


Idea::
S relies on the high frequencies and is considerably different from the other
two so take high frequencies(ring) as the first feature. The T and V are similar
in many ways, however they have a large difference when it comes to T's
horizontal line, so taking this as a feature distinguishes V from T


Fourier space -  what we did.
ring doesnt seem that good now, both V and T have similar values, this makes sense as it capures all four of thier lines
T and S also appear to have similar box valuues

again sector does not help us very much with S. Everything points at using a box for S as it seems it has more frequency than appear (high frequencies)


Test data is always alot larger than the training data, causing NN to classify with most spread class all the time (S)

==============================================
Testing Diff

> Having both the sectors (1 Box(T) and Ring) causes the S and V's to be confused

===============================================




% Comparison of various pairs of features

% Ring vs Sector Values --> Clusters are not great. They're quite close
% together and it can easily cause problems during classification

% Sector vs Box Values --> Clusters are much better, very little
% interaction between the points. Good decision boundary with veronoi

% Ring vs Box Values --> Not as great clusters as Sector V Box. But Still
% better than Ring V Sector. Would prefer Sector vs Box Values


# Our attempts

> Not ring : Everything was symmetrical and does not give us enough dinstinctness 
> We avoid the DC component : there's no real infomation gained from it
> Sectors for S : Empty sectors --> got too much of T and bits of V for angled


# Why we chose what we did
> Square on top ~~ Takes main core of T and it's quite distinct from other letters
> Sectors on the sides covering V ~~ Far away from T, Takes main parts of V giving V's a higher value, and doesn't take too much noise from S.
