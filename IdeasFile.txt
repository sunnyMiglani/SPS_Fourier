It's mentioned in the lecture "features" in Majid's lectures that

"Common to extract features by
measuring the power in specific
regions of the spectrum.
"

This makes me think we might need to first extract a part of the fourier space using a mask/filter
then from that area, calculate the "power" and use that to make a feature

Trying to extract features with the following
T - Box in the centre
S - Ring
V - Two sectors on either side



==================
TODO:

Change the noise_filter function to use some form of masking rahter than the current solution of setting everything
to 0s. 
Suggested things are butterworth's filter.



=================== 
Pseudo Code for the formulae: 

Ring :

	if( sqrt(sqr(r_a)-sqr(u)) <= V) && if( sqrt(sqr(r_b)-sqr(u)) >= V)
				{
					// Notice the values senpai 

				}
		else // Move on


	functions in matlab : 
		Square Root : sqrt(x)

		Square :: you can just type r_a * r_a cant you?

		Absolute : abs(z)
