It's mentioned in the lecture "features" in Majid's lectures that

"Common to extract features by
measuring the power in specific
regions of the spectrum."

This makes me think we might need to first extract a part of the fourier space using a mask/filter
then from that area, calculate the "power" and use that to make a feature
